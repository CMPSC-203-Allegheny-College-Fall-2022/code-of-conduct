# Code of Conduct

## Due Date

Thursday, September 8th, 2022 at 11:00 am

## Summary

This repository contains the conduct guide for [CMPSC 203, Software Engineering, Fall 2022](https://github.com/CMPSC-203-Allegheny-College-Fall-2022/course_information). The instructor and students will use this conduct guide to govern all course interactions.

## Improving the Conduct Guide

In this course, you will work collaboratively to design, implement, test, document, and deploy sustainable software. As you complete tasks to create this software, and as you participate in other course activities, you are responsible for adhering to this conduct guide as well as any other team contracts that emerge.

By the end of this exercise, you should know how to demonstrate mastery of the following essential technical skills of software engineering:

- How to follow GitHub flow
- How to review pull requests

## Instructions

### Delegating Categories to Teams

A template for the conduct guide has been provided in `conduct.md`. For this assignment, please use [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to collaboratively complete the conduct guide. In the conduct guide, you should describe the student and instructor behaviors that are acceptable and unacceptable in the context of this course. Students are invited to review the [Codes of Values from MIT's Course on Product Engineering Processes](https://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/team_manual/code_of_values.html). Make sure that the conduct guide explains how infractions will be handled.

The template for the Code of Conduct contains numerous categories of conduct that must be completed. All teams should come together to delegate which categories will be completed by which teams. Details from this discussion should be documented in the [issue tracker for the Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CMPSC-203-Allegheny-College-Fall-2022/code-of-conduct/issues).

### Determining Format

In this class-wide discussion, teams should also determine the format in which they will write their Code of Conduct. Though the template provides the overall structure for the Code of Conduct, teams should consider and agree upon how they will word their introductory paragraphs and acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. For instance, what information should the introductory paragraphs contain? Will students be referred to as "we" or "students"? Will the behaviors be written as declarative or imperative sentences? Details from this discussion should be documented in the issue tracker for the Code of Conduct.

### Drafting Your Team's Portion of the Code of Conduct

Your team should work together to draft your team's portion of the Code of Conduct. You should discuss what the introductory paragraph(s) and behaviors will be and ensure that every team member has agreed upon the contents of your team's portion of the Code of Conduct.

## Delegating Tasks to Individuals

Keeping in mind that every team member must contribute to the Code of Conduct using GitHub flow, your team should decide who will add what to your team's portion of the Code of Conduct. If any of your team members are absent during the class and/or laboratory sessions, your team should expect that they will contribute at a later time and reserve tasks for them. Your team should aim to divide tasks in a way that enables every team member to equally contribute to the Code of Conduct.

## Contributing to the Code of Conduct

You should contribute to your team's portion of the Code of Conduct using [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). Specifically, you should make sure to create a descriptively named branch from the `main` branch and commit and push your work within this branch. When you are ready to merge your changes, you should first merge the `main` branch into your branch and resolve any merge conflicts. Then, you should open a pull request, making sure to fill out all parts of the pull request template, and request review from another team member, the technical leader assigned to your team, and the instructor. Please note that every team member must review at least one pull request that they did not author, so your team should coordinate pull requests reviews in a way that enables every team member to review at least one pull request.

You should respond to any feedback from the review. Once you get approval from all reviewers, you should merge your branch into the `main` branch and delete your branch.

### Reviewing Changes

As you review pull requests, you should look for correct execution of GitHub flow and make sure that the proposed changes reflect the discussions in the issue tracker and follow the format agreed upon during the class-wide discussion.

## Opening a Pull Request for Your Team

Once all team members have merged their pull requests and agree that your team's portion of the Code of Conduct is complete, one team member should open a pull request to merge your team's branch into the Code of Conduct repository. In this pull request, you should request review from all technical leaders, a representative from _each_ of the other teams, and the instructor. Once you get approval from the majority of technical leaders, all representatives of the other teams, and the instructor, you should merge your work.

## Reviewing Other Teams' Forks

As each team opens a pull request to merge its branch of the Code of Conduct repository, every member of your team, even if they are not listed as a reviewer, should look over their proposed changes. If you have any feedback for a team, you should add it as a comment to their pull request. Once you approve of their proposed changes, meaning also that you agree to adhere to the portion of the Code of Conduct being proposed, you should communicate your approval to your team member who is your team's representative for that pull request. Your team's representative should only approve the pull request once all team members have communicated to the representative their approval and agreement to adherence.

## Assessment Strategy

This assignment will be assessed based on the following components:

- **GitHub Actions Build Status**: Students will receive a checkmark for this component if their last before-the-deadline build passes and a green ✔ appears in their GitHub commit log instead of a red ✗. As with the previous grading component, students are encouraged to repeatedly revise their source code and/or technical writing in an attempt to get their GitHub Actions build to pass.

  - Please note that spell checking, which is run in GitHub Actions, may flag proper nouns or other real words if the dictionary it uses does not contain them. To get your GitHub Actions build to pass, you will need to add correctly spelled words that are incorrectly flagged as "unknown" to the list of words in `.github/cspell.json`.

- **Mastery of Technical Concepts and Skills**: Students will also receive a checkmark for demonstrating mastery of each of the following technical concepts and skills. Receiving checkmarks for all of the following skills indicates that they have mastered all of the learning objectives of this assignment. For this assignment, you must:

  - Create a descriptively named branch
  - Commit and push work in created branch
  - Make small, focused commits
  - Write commit messages that abide by [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
  - Open a pull request, making sure to fill out all parts of the pull request template, and add all required reviewers
  - Respond to review feedback, practicing humility, respect, and trust
  - Merge your pull request
  - Review a pull request that you did not author in your team's fork, practicing humility, respect, and trust
