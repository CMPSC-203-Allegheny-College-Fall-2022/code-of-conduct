#### Acceptable Conduct

Students are encouraged to:

- Be proactive about communicating. This can include utilizing whatever platforms necessary to let other know ahead of time of any kinds of changes, concerns, or ideas.

- Constructively criticize others. For example, students should give honest and beneficial suggestions that do not alienate others and their work, which will encourage later participation. 

- Acknowledge others. Students should not isolate themselves or isolate others from any form of communication. Students should pull one another, and themselves, into the loop.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

Students are discouraged to:

- Be passive aggressive/disrespectful. When communicating it is essential to be careful about the way you speak, so that others are not offended or hurt by your words.

- Never ask questions. Students should always be willing to use the communication platforms to resolve any sort of questions they may have.

- Never listen to criticism/feedback. The constructive criticism and feedback given by others is important to take in and consider. They are giving feedback to help better your work.
