### Infractions

Below, we will be outlining what is acceptable and unacceptable conduct. If followed,
there should be no problems throughout the course of the year. Infraction is the act
of breaking something, so for this class this will mean the act of
breaking acceptable conduct. You should be able to follow all of the acceptable
conducts in the class, and that will lead
to a good, and efficient year in this class.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Acceptable work would be turning work in to the class on time. Make sure that
assignments aren't late and have a passing build.
- Acceptable work would contain work being completed to the highest level of
completion. Use concepts that we have learned to class and apply it to the work on
projects.
- Acceptable work would also consist following the Honor Code from Allegheny College with work in the class.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Unacceptable work would consist of being turning in work late after a certain
deadline.
- Unacceptable work would also consist of not following other class rules and taking advantage of the system of the class.
- Unacceptable work would also contain not doing the work in the class and not
turning in assignments of the class.
