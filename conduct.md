### Infractions

Below, we will be outlining what is acceptable and unacceptable conduct. If followed, there should be no problems
throughout the course of the year. Infraction is the act of breaking something, so for this class this will mean the act of
breaking acceptable conduct. You should be able to follow all of the acceptable conducts in the class, and that will lead
to a good, and efficient year in this class.
