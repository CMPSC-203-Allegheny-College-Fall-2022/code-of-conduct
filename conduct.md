### Decisions

TODO: Write an introductory paragraph.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Create decision that mutually benefit each other (Schedules, Coding). This is to help understand each other's responsibilities and respect on what is possible for both individual interest and the team interest.

- Decisions made in the class in terms of software engineering whether assignments or group work projects should be inline with the code of conduct and not biased to any particular student.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Never informing on others on unattended appointments. This will only create more problems as other team members has to do more work unexpectedly, therefore the work will not be as good as intended to be.

- It is unacceptable to make decisions in the class alone when collaborating on a project as it is group work and decisions are aimed to be made as a group so as to enhance teamwork and collaboration.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Always be transparent on what are we doing wrong with. The reason being is because to create a mutual relationship environment between the team to understand the good and the bad of the activity together.

- It is acceptable and anticipated that after doing and completing the task, you hover through the completed task ensuring every task is completed and completed correctly following the guidelines and instructions provided.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Never create unnecessary mistakes (Forget to git pull, never creating pull requests). This is very important to not create more problems and not to halt on the team's progress on the work.

- It is unacceptable to submit incomplete projects and not follow through with the course instructor to get more insight and help on the project.The aim is to learn not complete tasks and understanding concepts is key!
