### Communication

Communication is the cornerstone of collaboration, and all communications for team-based activities in the Software Engineering course must adhere to the below guidelines for professionalism. To be clear, we recognize two platforms for our official communication: Discord and GitHub. That having been said, the below guidelines ought to be followed for any in-person communication pertaining to or within the classroom.

#### Acceptable Conduct

Students are encouraged to:

- Be proactive about communicating. This can include utilizing whatever platforms necessary to let others know ahead of time of any kinds of changes, concerns, or ideas.

- Constructively criticize others. For example, students should give honest and beneficial suggestions that do not alienate others and their work, which will encourage later participation.

- Acknowledge others. Students should not isolate themselves or isolate others from any form of communication. Students should pull one another, and themselves, into the loop.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

Students are discouraged from:

- Never ask questions. Students should always be willing to use the communication platforms to resolve any sort of questions they may have.
