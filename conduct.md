# Conduct Guide for Software Engineering

## Categories of Conduct

### Overall Conduct

It is expected that the main attitude in the class is to be encouraging and positive, towards yourself and each other. Since this class is mainly based on teams, it is very important that everyone respects each others contribution and provides constructive feedback when necessary. All students are expected to show respect to everyone both inside, and outside the classroom. Students are expected to come to class on time and prepared for collaboration.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students coming to every class.
- Pay attention in class and take notes.
- Not distracting other people in class.
- Be respectful.
- Be constructive with feedback.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Not coming to class.
- Students not bringing their computer.
- Distracting people in class.
- Disrespectful towards peers, TA's and Professor.

### Deadlines

The deadline for each task should be 12am. This will help other contributors to review and make changes where necessary before class time in order to have a sense of clarity on with problems need to be resolved or worked on. Deadlines also help with feedback that is always necessary for the project we will be doing.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Doing the work on time.
- Telling the team that you finished your work.
- Doing the work with time and do not rush things.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

Students should participate in a meaningful capacity during this course. This section will outline the acceptable and unacceptable conduct when it comes to class participation. Students should follow these guidelines when participating in classroom activities.

- Participate in class discussions.
- Ask questions when needed.
- Attend class regularly.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Not participating at all throughout class sessions
- Not paying attention while in class
- Doing other classwork during designated class time
- Skipping class

### Decisions

Decisions are the action or process of deciding something or of resolving a question. Decisions are the process of making choices by identifying a decision, gathering information, and assessing alternative resolutions.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Create decision that mutually benefit each other (Schedules, Coding). This is to help understand each other's responsibilities and respect on what is possible for both individual interest and the team interest.

- Decisions made in the class in terms of software engineering whether assignments or group work projects should be inline with the code of conduct and not biased to any particular student.

- If all group members do not agree on a decision, alternative choices should be proposed. This would allow group members to come to a compromise if they do not agree with the course the project is being taken in.


#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Never informing on others on unattended appointments. This will only create more problems as other team members has to do more work unexpectedly, therefore the work will not be as good as intended to be.

- It is unacceptable to make decisions in the class alone when collaborating on a project as it is group work and decisions are aimed to be made as a group so as to enhance teamwork and collaboration.

- Group members should not make major decisions just before the due date. In other words, major aspects of the project should not be changed at the last minute since there would not be enough time to fully implement these changes.

### Postmortems

Postmortems is an analysis or discussion of an event held soon after it has occurred, especially in order to determine
why it was a failure. A post-mortem is where a team reflects on what went wrong with something they did, and documents
it and/or amends their process to stop it happening again.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Always be transparent on what are we doing wrong with. The reason being is because to create a mutual relationship environment between the team to understand the good and the bad of the activity together.

- Accept criticism both positive and negative. So that you can grow as a team member and software engineer.

- Be flexible. Don't be unwilling to change your process if it's not working.


#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Never create unnecessary mistakes (Forget to git pull, never creating pull requests). This is very important to not create more problems and not to halt on the team's progress on the work.

- Pushing all the blame onto one person. We're all part of our own teams and as team members if we all try our best the responsibility should be shared.
